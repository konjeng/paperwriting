\part{}One of the important aspect of e-commerce is the feedback generated by users in the form of customer reviews, blogs, and forum posts. This paper presents a new approach to finding relationship between aspects of user reviews and suggest a way to summarize reviews using this aspect ontology tree. Users often go through the product reviews to get an insight into product quality and its various aspects (akan aspects). However, as reviews are unstructured and voluminous, users face a difficulty finding the relevant information. Users have different preferences and thus for each user there is a subset of product aspects that the user cares the most. From the large number of reviews, it is difficult for users to find the subset of reviews that give information about the product aspects that the user considers most important. Apart from searching reviews that contain information about specific aspects, another challenge that users face is lack of domain knowledge about the product. They donâ€™t know what are all the different aspects and sub-aspects of the product, and how these aspects are related with each other. Although this information is there in the product reviews, it is very difficult for users to get it directly from the reviews. In this paper, we propose a novel interactive search interface, similar to popular faceted navigation, to address the above problems. To solve our problem, we need to create an aspect ontology tree with very high degree precision. We propose a technique to construct ontology from product review with much  higher precision compared to existing techniques.
