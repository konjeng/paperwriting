\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

In this report, ranking of product reviews and ways to optimize the ranking 
has been discussed. Initially, different types of methods to extract useful 
information from reviews was discussed. An approach to enhance the ranking 
system by also incorporating experience of reviewer has been proposed. The 
approach first started with baseline ranking of reviews, then concept of 
domain experts in product reivew system was introduced. An approach to 
integrate domain expertise into baseline review system was proposed. 
Then a challenge of taking into account the idea of related categories 
for expertise was solved by finding similarity between categories. 
All these approaches are presented in combined form which will help 
consumers make their purchase decision easily.

To implement the proposed methodologies, an Amazon dataset was 
downloaded from SNAP (a stanford university network data analysis portal). 
Whole dataset contained 34 million reviews. We worked on Electronics 
category containing 1.6 million reviews using MySql as the database 
and python as the programming language.
